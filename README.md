# Interest Calc

**Interest Calc** is a simple and fun compound interest calculator designed to make investment projections easier. The goal is to be an intuitive, easily accessible calculator without ads and with reliable results.

## Project Description

Interest Calc calculates compound interest based on an initial value, a monthly contribution, and an interest rate (annual or monthly) for a set period of time (years or months). The application shows the total investment, the accumulated interest, and the total amount, as well as graphically displaying these values month by month. A detailed table complements the graph, showing the interest for that month, the total invested so far, the accumulated interest, and the overall total, allowing you to track monthly progress.
